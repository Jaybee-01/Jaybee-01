##👋 Hi, I'm Joshua Emmanuel!

I'm a passionate Frontend Developer and Computer Science student at Bayero University, Kano. I specialize in building simple, responsive, and user-friendly web interfaces using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I'm also exploring the world of UI/UX with Figma and actively growing my skills through self-learning and hands-on projects.

💡 During my internships at 360 Mass Hub and Prodigy InfoTech, I mentored others in web development, assisted in teaching junior learners, and contributed to real-world projects — including some volunteered roles — that sharpened both my technical and soft skills.

🛠️ Skills & Tools:
HTML · CSS · JavaScript · Figma (beginner) · Git & GitHub · Communication · Teamwork

🌱 I'm currently learning more about modern frameworks and improving my frontend development knowledge at AltSchool Africa.

📁 I’m working on my personal portfolio and looking for opportunities to collaborate, learn, and grow as a developer.

Let’s connect and build something impactful!
